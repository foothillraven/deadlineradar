# DeadlineRadar reminders — the "remind me" feature

**Status: built, dry-run tested end-to-end, abuse-hardened (2026-07-03 audit), NOT
deployed. Zero real emails have ever been sent — `DryRunSender` (now wrapped in a send
circuit breaker) is the only sender wired up anywhere in this codebase.**

## What this is

A signup form (on every state page + the homepage) that captures an email address and enough
state-specific detail (birth month, cohort group, etc.) to compute *that person's own* renewal
deadline, then emails them reminders on an escalating schedule as it approaches: **60, 30, 14, 7,
3, and 1 day before.** Double opt-in, one-click unsubscribe, one-click "I've renewed" that halts
reminders instantly, and an offer to re-arm for the next cycle.

## Product requirements this satisfies

- **Zero spam.** The email is used for exactly one thing: reminders about the deadline the person
  signed up for. Never sold, never shared, never repurposed for anything else — there is no code
  path anywhere in this feature that does anything else with an email address.
- **Trust-first UX.** The signup form shows the privacy microcopy ("We only email you deadline
  reminders. We never sell or share your address. Unsubscribe anytime.") *before* the email
  field, not after.
- **Double opt-in.** Signing up sends a confirmation email; nothing else happens until that link
  is clicked. An unconfirmed signup gets exactly one email, ever.
- **Escalating reminders**, exactly the requested cadence, verified end-to-end (see Testing below)
  to fire each threshold exactly once, never twice, never skipped.
- **One-click "I've renewed"** on every reminder, halts immediately, offers to re-arm for next
  cycle. **One-click unsubscribe**, halts immediately and permanently — verified in the test suite
  that an unsubscribed (not "renewed") subscriber can never be silently re-armed; they'd have to
  sign up fresh, which is itself explicit re-consent.

## Architecture

```
reminders/
  store.py        subscriber storage (subscribers.json, GITIGNORED -- real PII)
  sender.py        pluggable email-sender interface; DryRunSender is the only one active
  emails.py        all email copy (confirmation, 6 reminder stages, stop-confirmation)
  scheduler.py     escalation logic -- reuses generate.py's OWN date-math functions
  server.py        stdlib http.server backend: /subscribe /confirm /unsubscribe /renewed /rearm
  test_dry_run_e2e.py   real end-to-end test (run it: see Testing below)
  subscribers.example.json   fake-data schema example (the real file is gitignored)
```

Stdlib only — no new dependencies, matching the rest of this repo. The signup form itself lives
in `generate.py` (the static site generator), not here — see "Site-side form" below.

### Why the deadline computation reuses `generate.py`, not a re-implementation

`scheduler.py` imports `next_birth_month_parity_date` and `next_annual_month_end` directly from
`generate.py` rather than re-deriving the same math. Two implementations of the same date rule
can drift apart over time as one gets edited and the other doesn't — reusing the exact functions
means the reminder a subscriber gets can never disagree with what the state's own page displays.

For fixed-calendar states, the scheduler reads the same `next_deadline_computed` values from
`data/cpa_deadlines.json` the static site uses, and inherits the exact same wall-clock staleness
guard (`check_data_freshness()`, mirroring `generate.py`'s `STALENESS_THRESHOLD_DAYS` check) — the
reminder scheduler refuses to run on data more than 30 days unverified, for the same reason the
site refuses to build on it.

### Site-side form

`generate.py` gained a `signup_form_for_state()` (state pages, all fields known statically) and
`signup_form_homepage()` (homepage, state picked at runtime via a small vanilla-JS show/hide
handler — the only JS on the site, used because it clearly helps here). Every field the backend
needs to compute a deadline is collected: license-type picker for Florida/Georgia's multiple
cohorts, birth month + year for California, birth month for Texas, cohort group for Ohio. **New
York has no signup form at all** — same honesty as the static site: its rule depends on a fact
(first-registration date) this dataset doesn't have, so no reminder can be computed for it.

## Abuse-hardening (2026-07-03 audit)

The product promise is zero spam — which cuts both ways. Before this ever touches a real
inbox, it has to be safe against a STRANGER using the signup form to spam a THIRD
PARTY (enrolling someone else's address, bombing an inbox, flooding the system with
bots). Audited against 7 rows, each enforced in code with its own attack-simulation test
in `test_dry_run_e2e.py`. **This ran in two passes, and the second one mattered as much
as the first:**

**Pass 1** built the defenses below and wrote same-file tests (Parts 11–17) asserting
they held. **Pass 2** was an INDEPENDENT adversarial workflow — seven separate agents,
each handed only the row it was attacking and told to write its own fresh attack script
(not read or trust the pass-1 tests) and try to actually break the live server/store.
**It broke 5 of the 7 rows.** Every finding below was real, reproduced with a concrete
request/input, and is now fixed with its own regression test (Parts 18–22) targeting the
exact bypass found — this is the same "don't trust your own done" pattern that already
paid off three times earlier this sprint (see HANDOFF.md), now run on this feature a
second time on the same day.

1. **Double opt-in.** Design: a signup can never trigger more than the one confirmation
   email until that link is clicked. **Pass 2 broke this**: `store.stop()` and
   `store.rearm()` never checked whether a subscriber had ever actually been confirmed —
   a still-*pending* record's OWN signup-time tokens (issued before `/confirm` is ever
   clicked) could reach `/renewed` then `/rearm` and flip all the way to
   `status=confirmed`, after which the real scheduler sent it a live reminder — a full
   double-opt-in bypass with no `/confirm` click anywhere in the chain. Separately,
   `/unsubscribe` on a still-pending record triggered a SECOND email, violating "an
   unconfirmed signup gets exactly one email, ever." **Fixed:** `stop()` now refuses
   `reason="renewed"` unless `confirmed_at is not None` (the renewed-link is never even
   included in the confirmation email, only in reminder emails that pending records never
   receive, so reaching it on a pending record is never legitimate); `rearm()`
   independently re-checks the same `confirmed_at` requirement as belt-and-suspenders;
   `/unsubscribe` still honors a pending record's own token (the confirmation email's
   footer legitimately contains it) but no longer sends a second email if it was never
   confirmed.
2. **Dedupe + cooldown.** Design: `store.within_signup_cooldown()` / `find_active_or_pending()`
   block repeat submissions of the same address, keyed on a normalized (stripped,
   lowercased) email. **Pass 2 broke this**: Gmail-style dot-insensitivity and `+tag`
   sub-addressing (`victim.name@gmail.com` / `victim.name+a@gmail.com` /
   `vic.tim.name@gmail.com`, all delivered to the same real inbox by Gmail) were treated
   as distinct addresses, letting an attacker generate multiple confirmation-email sends
   to one real inbox inside the cooldown window. **Fixed:** cooldown/dedupe now key on a
   separate `_cooldown_key()` that additionally folds `+tag` suffixes and dots in the
   local part — deliberately more aggressive than the exact address used for actual
   delivery/storage/suppression, since over-folding here just shares a cooldown window
   between two unrelated people (self-correcting), while under-folding is what let a
   stranger spam a real inbox.
3. **Bot defense.** Design: a hidden honeypot field + per-IP rate limiter. Rate limiting
   held up completely under attack (no IP-spoofing-header bypass, no cross-bucket
   leakage). **Pass 2 broke the honeypot**: the check used `.strip()`-truthiness, so a
   whitespace-only fill (a single space) slipped through as "empty." **Fixed:** checks
   the raw field value's emptiness directly (`is not None and != ""`), not its stripped
   form.
4. **Send circuit breaker.** Design: a hard daily cap enforced by
   `sender.CircuitBreakerSender`. **Pass 2 broke this under concurrency**: the
   load-check-increment-save sequence had no lock and no atomic write; a 40-thread burst
   against a cap of 5 let through up to 14 real sends (not 5), and a write landing
   mid-read from another thread could crash the reader with `JSONDecodeError`. **Fixed:**
   a module-level `threading.Lock` (not instance-level — `get_sender()` can hand back a
   fresh instance per call, so only a process-wide lock actually serializes every
   send) now guards the whole critical section, and state-file writes are atomic
   (temp file + `os.replace`). Regression test drives 40 real threads at a cap of 5 and
   asserts the real send count never exceeds it.
5. **Permanent suppression.** Design: `store.is_permanently_suppressed()`, keyed on
   `stop_reason` rather than `status` so a hypothetical status-corruption bug can't
   resurrect a real unsubscribe. **Pass 2 broke this in the OVER-blocking direction**:
   the check suppressed EVERY future signup for an email that had EVER unsubscribed —
   even a wholly separate, genuinely re-confirmed record for a different state — which
   is a real product-breaking bug (a customer who unsubscribes once could never
   resubscribe with that address, for anything, ever), and directly contradicts "never
   re-emailed unless THEY re-initiate." **Fixed:** suppression now lifts if ANY record for
   the email has a `confirmed_at` later than the most recent unsubscribe's `stopped_at` —
   a genuine later `/confirm` click IS the person re-initiating consent. Verified this
   didn't weaken the original defense-in-depth guarantee: a status-corrupted record with
   no new confirm timestamp still stays suppressed (same test as before, still passing).
6. **Input validation / sanitization.** Stricter email regex, control-character sweep,
   8KB body cap, numeric fields parsed inside `try/except`, deadline-computability
   checked on a throwaway probe before any record is persisted (fixes an orphaned-record
   bug pass 1 itself found), `check_data_freshness()`'s `SystemExit` now caught explicitly
   so stale data degrades to a 503 instead of killing the whole process. **Pass 2 could
   not break this row** — a genuinely thorough, independent attempt (oversized fields,
   NUL bytes, multi-address emails, RTLO/zero-width unicode, 300+ char emails, huge-int
   and out-of-range birth months, missing/non-numeric/lying `Content-Length`) came back
   clean. The one PASS among the five FAILs.
7. **PII locality.** Runtime behavior was clean in both passes (no PII in stdout/HTTP
   responses, nothing ever historically committed). **Pass 2 found a real gap in
   `.gitignore` itself**: it enumerated exact filenames plus a `_test_*` prefix, which
   missed any OTHER scratch-file naming convention — reproduced live, not hypothetically,
   by a sibling attack agent's own leftover `_attack_row6_script.py` sitting untracked in
   the working tree during the same session. **Fixed:** replaced the enumerated list with
   a content-shape denylist (`reminders/*.json` / `*.jsonl`, with `subscribers.example.json`
   explicitly re-included) plus a general `reminders/_*` scratch-file rule (with
   `__init__.py` explicitly re-included so the real source file isn't dropped) — this
   catches `_test_*`, `_attack_*`, and any future prefix automatically.

**73/73 checks passed after pass 1. 96/96 pass after pass 2's fixes** (23 more checks:
17 attack-simulation groups from pass 1, plus 5 new regression-test groups — Parts
18–22 — targeting the exact bypasses pass 2 found, one per broken row).

**Hosting note:** GitHub Pages (where `docs/` is hosted) is static-only and cannot run
this backend. `HOSTING_PROPOSAL.md` proposes Cloudflare Workers + D1 as the natural next
step (the project is already on Cloudflare) — a proposal only, not deployed, not
decided. Standing up any public endpoint is a plan-first item per CLAUDE.md.

## The deployment gap (real, not yet solved — needs a decision)

The static site (`docs/`) can be hosted for free on GitHub Pages. **This backend cannot** — Pages
serves static files only, it can't run `server.py`. Before any real signup can work, the backend
needs to run somewhere reachable from the public internet (options: a small always-on host, a
serverless function behind an API gateway, etc.) — that's a hosting decision with its own cost/
complexity tradeoffs, separate from the free Pages hosting for the static site, and **not made
yet**. `REMINDER_BACKEND_BASE_URL` (in `generate.py`) and `BACKEND_BASE_URL` (in `emails.py`) are
both placeholders (`https://example-deadlineradar-api.test`) — swap both, together, once a real
backend host exists.

## What's needed from the project maintainer (surfacing, not doing myself)

1. **A transactional email-service account + API key.** `sender.py` has a ready `SendGridSender`
   stub (SendGrid picked as the example since it has a workable free tier; Postmark/SES would be
   similar swaps). Until a real `SENDGRID_API_KEY` exists in the environment, `get_sender()` stays
   hardcoded to `DryRunSender` — flipping that is a deliberate one-line code change, not something
   an environment variable can silently trigger.
2. **A real physical mailing address for the email footer.** CAN-SPAM legally requires a valid
   physical postal address in every commercial email — this is not something that can be
   fabricated. The current placeholder (`MAILING_ADDRESS_PLACEHOLDER` in `emails.py`) is
   deliberately impossible to miss so a real send could never accidentally go out without a real
   address in it. A PO box or a commercial mail-receiving agency is the normal solution for a
   project like this.
3. **A hosting decision for the backend** (see "deployment gap" above).
4. Anything that costs money or stands up a public endpoint is gated on explicit approval — none
   of the above happens without that.

## PII security

`subscribers.json` (real email addresses) and `dry_run_sent.log.jsonl` (which contains the same
PII, since dry-run logs exactly what *would* have been sent) are both `.gitignore`d. Only
`subscribers.example.json` — fake data, `@example.invalid` addresses — is tracked. `server.py`
overrides `log_message()` to a no-op so request lines never hit stdout/logs (belt-and-suspenders;
our endpoints only ever put opaque tokens in query strings, never raw email addresses, but this
closes the door on that class of accidental leak regardless).

## Testing

`python -m reminders.test_dry_run_e2e` (run from `b3_saas/deadlineradar/`) — a real end-to-end
test, not mocks: exercises `store.py`'s state machine directly, walks a simulated clock through
every escalation threshold and confirms each fires exactly once, confirms unsubscribe permanently
halts even as later thresholds are crossed, confirms the renewed-vs-unsubscribed re-arm
distinction, confirms New York is correctly unsupported rather than given a fabricated deadline,
confirms California/Texas/Florida's special fields all resolve correctly, and finishes with a real
HTTP smoke test — an actual `HTTPServer` instance, real `urllib` requests, not simulated calls —
against `/health`, `/subscribe`, and `/confirm`, including invalid-input rejection paths. Test
storage/log files are isolated from the real ones and deleted whether the run passes or fails.

**96/96 checks pass**, including 3 regression tests (Parts 8-10) added after an earlier
adversarial review found and this build fixed 3 real correctness bugs the *original*
33-check suite didn't catch (because it only ever advanced the clock to exact threshold
boundaries), 7 attack-simulation test groups (Parts 11-17) from the 2026-07-03
abuse-hardening audit's first pass, and 5 more regression-test groups (Parts 18-22) added
after an independent adversarial workflow broke 5 of those 7 rows on a second,
separate pass — see "Abuse-hardening" above for the full story of what each attacks:

1. **Reminder emails showed the wrong "days from now"** whenever a subscriber's first evaluation
   didn't land exactly on a threshold (e.g. confirmed 40 days out, crossing the 60-day tier,
   previously said "60 days from now" instead of the true 40). Fixed by separating the threshold
   (picks the tone) from the actual computed days-remaining (what's displayed) — see
   `emails.reminder_email()`.
2. **A scheduler gap could send a less-urgent reminder AFTER a more-urgent one already fired**
   (e.g. "3 days left" arriving after "tomorrow is the deadline" already went out, because a
   missed run left the 3-day tier technically un-sent). Fixed in `scheduler.next_due_threshold()`
   — once the most urgent tier a subscriber has received fires, no less-urgent tier can ever fire
   after it.
3. **A subscriber whose first-ever evaluation happened after their deadline already passed got
   silently zero reminders, forever.** Fixed with a bounded catch-up window (14 days past
   deadline): a never-notified subscriber inside that window gets one final 1-day-tier reminder
   instead of silence; beyond it, correctly abandoned as a stale signup.

Also fixed as part of the same review: **the stop-confirmation email (sent after unsubscribe or
"I've renewed") carried a dead, empty unsubscribe link** — every other email template built a real
one from the subscriber's token, these two passed an empty string. Fixed in `server.py`.

No real email was sent at any point in testing — the only sender exercised anywhere in this suite
is `DryRunSender`.

## Known limitations (found by adversarial review, not fixed this pass — documented, not hidden)

- **Unsubscribe/renewed/rearm links stop working after a re-arm.** `store.rearm()` issues fresh
  tokens for the new cycle, so a link embedded in an *already-sent* email from the prior cycle
  (e.g. the original confirmation email) 404s after a re-arm. Not a security issue (fails closed,
  not open), but it means an old email's unsubscribe link isn't permanently reliable the way the
  product promise implies. Fix path: keep prior-cycle tokens valid as aliases rather than fully
  replacing them.
- **`/confirm`, `/unsubscribe`, `/renewed`, `/rearm` are plain `GET`s with side effects.** This is
  an extremely common pattern (CAN-SPAM's one-click bar pushes most implementations this way), but
  it means a corporate email-security link-prefetcher could in principle trigger one of these
  before a human ever opens the email. Fix path: make the `GET` show a confirmation page with a
  button that `POST`s the actual action.
- ~~No de-duplication on repeat signup.~~ **Fixed in the 2026-07-03 abuse-hardening audit** —
  see "Abuse-hardening" row 2 above (`store.within_signup_cooldown()` / `find_active_or_pending()`).
- **No file locking on `subscribers.json`.** Every read-modify-write is a full file overwrite with
  no locking. Two overlapping requests (e.g. the scheduler running while a `/subscribe` request is
  in flight) could race. Low likelihood for a single-operator local/staged setup; worth revisiting
  before any real-scale deployment — moot if/when the Cloudflare D1 hosting proposal is adopted,
  since D1 handles concurrent writes itself.
- **The in-memory per-IP rate limiter is single-process and resets on restart.** Fine for this
  local reference implementation; a real deployment needs a shared store (see
  `HOSTING_PROPOSAL.md` — Cloudflare's Rate Limiting rules / Durable Objects, not an in-process dict).
- **The 24h signup cooldown blocks a legitimate "I never got the email, let me try again" retry
  for the same window it blocks an attacker.** Deliberate tradeoff — a dedicated "resend
  confirmation" flow (which would need its own abuse-hardening, e.g. only resending to the
  original address, never creating a new record) is a reasonable future addition, not built here.

## Running the backend locally (dry-run only)

```
cd b3_saas/deadlineradar
python -m reminders.server
```

Serves on `http://127.0.0.1:8791`. Every "sent" email is appended to
`reminders/dry_run_sent.log.jsonl` (gitignored) instead of actually being sent — inspect that file
to see exactly what would have gone out.
